WebLogic libs
============

wlfullclient - Not included by default 
wlcipher.jar - Not included by default (required for T3S connections) 
DemoTrust.jks - taken from a 12.1 install, required for SSL

WebLogic is ridiculous and doesn't have a neat HTTP API by default, so we
need to use WL libraries to invoke enterprise MBeans.
